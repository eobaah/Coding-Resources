From Leo Polovets via [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-software-engineer-write-a-killer-resume):

> **Discuss benefits, not features.** Your resume is a marketing piece, and you should treat it as such. If you're trying to sell a car, you won't get far by telling people how great the spark plugs are and how it "runs well." Instead, you could talk about how it smoothly handles tight curves at 50mph and how the parts are of such a high quality that the car won't need any scheduled maintenance for the first 10 years. In terms of your resume, don't focus on the spark plug details ("I implemented FooBar with C++ and STL") nor on the generic descriptions ("Designed and implemented custom solutions for an important client."). Instead, talk about how you improved the performance of something by 25x, or how you reduced the QA cycle from 2 days to 3 hours, or how it took you four months to implement the company's flagship product which is responsible for 45% of all revenue. These are the kinds of benefits that employers drool at.
